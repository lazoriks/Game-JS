## Other General Project Advice

Congratulations on completing your Tetris Game project! Feel free to explore additional features and enhancements to further improve the gaming experience.

Following the tutorials on the course page may not provide enough information and knowledge to create full-fledged games or interactive websites. Therefore, there is always a need to search for additional materials, courses, and information from other sources.

The book [Javascript for Kids UA](https://starylev.com.ua/javascript-dlya-ditey) helped me to learn Java.  The book describes the basics of the language, the main concepts and its application in a clear and understandable language for beginners. 
I also recommend that you consider and study with the help of the book [Head First JavaScript Programming](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-javascript/9781449340124/). With examples and in English. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
